# Segue-Project
Suppose you are developing an app that calculate the weight of a person in different 
planets. The starting view (earth view) takes the weight of the person on earth as shown in the 
following screen shot. Form earth, the person can move to the moon view using a segue. While 
moving to the moon, earth weight is also passed from the earth view to the moon view. The moon 
view  calculates  the  weight  on  moon  and  display  both  earth  weight,  moon  weight,  and  the 
message “I feel much lighter !”
